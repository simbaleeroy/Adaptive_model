# DDoS Detection Model Performance Analysis

Date: February 13, 2024
Environment: AWS EC2 t2.micro

## Test Setup

- Capture Duration: 15 seconds per test
- Normal Traffic: Generated using iperf3
- DDoS Traffic: Generated using hping3 SYN flood

## Model Performance

### Results Visualization

Traffic Type | Logistic | Neural Net | Random Forest | XGBoost   | SVM
------------|----------|------------|----------------|-----------|----------
normal      | 游릭       | 游댮         | 游릭              | 游릭        | 游릭
ddos        | 游댮       | 游댮         | 游댮              | 游댮        | 游댮

### Analysis

1. Model Accuracy
   - Logistic Regression: 100% accuracy (2/2 correct)
   - Neural Network: 50% accuracy (1/2 correct)
   - Random Forest: 100% accuracy (2/2 correct)
   - XGBoost: 100% accuracy (2/2 correct)
   - SVM: 100% accuracy (2/2 correct)

2. False Positives/Negatives
   - False Positives: Neural Network flagged normal traffic as DDoS
   - False Negatives: None - all models detected DDoS traffic

3. Model Reliability
   - Most Reliable: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost & SVM
   - Needs Improvement: Neural Network (tends to overclassify as DDoS)

## Recommendations

1. Primary Model Choice: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost & SVM
2. Neural Network could be used as secondary validation
3. Consider ensemble approach using majority voting

## Future Improvements

1. Test with different types of DDoS attacks
2. Increase capture duration for more data
3. Test with varied normal traffic patterns
